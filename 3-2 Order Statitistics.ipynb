    "# Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Last class we learned how to produce a distribution for the signle random variables $U$ produced from some formula applied ot a set of multivariate random variables. One of the specific problems we wanted to solve was to produce the distribution of a statistics computed from a sample of a signle variate random variable, for example the mean of the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "We came up with threee methods, and let's illustrate one of them with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The City of Greeley finds that their 10 most dangerous intersections have a similar distribution for the number of accidents per day:  They are Poisson with a mean of 0.5 accidents per day. Let $U$ be the average number of accidents at the 10 intersections in one day. I.e. $Y_i$ is the number of accidents at intersection $i$ and \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ U = \\frac{1}{10} Y_1 + \\frac{1}{10} Y_2 + \\dots + \\frac{1}{10} Y_{10} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the distribution of $U$. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Poisson Distribution \n",
    "\n",
    "The distributions of the $Y_i$ satisfy:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p(y) = \\frac{1}{2^y y!} e^{-1/2} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method of Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the method of distributions gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p_U(u) = \\sum_{y_1 + y_2 + \\dots + y_{10} = u} p(y_1) p(y_2) \\cdots p(y_{10}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "(where I cheated a little bit, form a discrete random varialbe we know that the the formula for the cummulative distribution turns into the distribution by just changing the inequality to equality)\n",
    "\n",
    "which because they are all exponential gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p_U(u) = \\frac{1}{2^u u!} e^{-5} \\sum_{y_1 + y_2 + \\dots + y_{10} = u} \\frac{u!}{y_1! y_2! \\cdots y_{10}!} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "And the sum then collapses to $10^u$ by the multinomial identity. [See here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_theorem).  You could also think of this in combinatorics as the number of ways of putting $u$ objects into $10$ bins.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p_U(u) = \\frac{5^u}{u!} e^{-5} $$\n",

    "# Order Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "However statistics computed by a formula applied to the sample are just one type of statistic we might care about. Another example of the type of statistics we might want to compute from a sample arise from the order of the sample:\n",

    "- The largest or smallest value from our sample.\n",
    "- The *Median* of our sample depends on the ordering of the values.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the example above we may wonder, in a given day what we expect the distribution of the maximum number of accidents at a single intersection to be. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "So the approach is the following:  Given a set of independent identically distributed random variables $Y_1, Y_2, \\dots Y_n$ we put them in order from smallest to largest \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example - Maximum $Y_{(n)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we would like to find the density or distribution of the $Y_{(1)}$. We use the method of distributions and compute the cummulative distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{(n)}(y) = P( Y_{(n)} < y ) $$\n",

    "$$ F_{(n)}(y) = P( Y_1 < y, Y_2 < y, \\dots, Y_n < y) = F(y)^n $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the last step is because the $Y_i$ are independent. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then get the density of the maximum value by taking a derivative:  $$ g_n(y) = n F(y)^{n-1} f(y) $$\n",
