    "## Course Description\n",
    "\n",
    "From the catalogue: A continuation of MATH 350. Learn about jointly distributed random variables, central limit theorem, sampling distributions, properties of estimation, confidence intervals and tests of hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topics will include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sampling distributions and other methods of experimentation;\n",
    "- Random variables and jointly distributed random variables;\n",
    "- Population samples and the central limit theorem;\n",
    "- Point and Interval Estimations\n",
    "- Hypothesis Tests\n",
    "- Bayesian Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programing\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics is a subject that is best treated as a science and in particular extensive experimentation with the problems being considered is essential to understanding the results. As a result we will be using Python (specifically Numpy, Sympy, and Scipy) to run experiments and do computations of results. You will be provided with example code that can be modified for the problems we do in class, and really this is meant partly to build upon your experience from the Introductory Programming class. That said, CS 120 is not a prequisite for the course and so we will have a gentle introduction to using Python and extensive help built into the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that you will not be asked to do Calculus computations by hand but instead will be able to use Sympy or Scipy algorithms for any integration results we need. \n",
    "\n",
    "The course materials for class are being written in Jupyter/Python and are available in Github as .ipynb files.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need access to Python, here are some options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To install it on your own computer or laptop I recommend downloading Anaconda: [https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) which includes Jupyter and Python.\n",
    "- Google Colabs provides a Jupyter-like environment and Python (including the packages we will use), it also is integrated with Github. You will need a gmail account. [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)\n"

    "While we will be using Python as part of class, CS 120 is not a prerequisite. We will have example programs to get started and will only use a small part of what Python offers as a programing language. This course in fact will serve as a nice introduction to Python programing.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will be following the textbook:  **Mathematical Statistics with Applications** by Wackerly, Mendenhall, and Scheaffer. While it is highly recommended, any problems or other work assigned will be provided separately and much of the course material can be found on the internet. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebooks and Github\n",
    "\n",
    "The notes for class and the homework is written in Jupyter notebooks. [We will use github to distribute these here](https://github.com/virgilpierce/MATH_351). I have made it a public repository so it should be easy to find. You have two choices for using this link, you can download individual files from the repository, or you can set up your Github account and then download or clone the repository to your own computer to then open the files in Jupyter. You can use the \"Issues\" tab in the Github website to let me know about problems you have seen in the notes (typos or things that don't run).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python References\n",
    "\n",
    "You may need a Python reference book, depending on whether you prefer a book or the web for referencing. Let me know if you would like me to recommend one.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, while I like to have a book to refer to for programing, most of the time it does not have the detail I need, and I end up using in-line help or on-line help anyway. By the way, here are some examples of how you can get some inline help in Python:"
