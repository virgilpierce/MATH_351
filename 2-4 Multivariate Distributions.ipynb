Yes we can now try to describe a single random variable by modelling it with one of our distributions or more generally by find expressions or approximations for the density or cummulative distribution functions. Of course reality is more complicated, and the interesting things happen when we consider how one random variable is impacted by another:\n",

The issue is that our test is not perfect:  Sometimes it returns a positive result when in fact the patient does not have the virus; and sometimes it returns a negative result when in fact the patient does have the virus. One challenge is to understand how effective a test actually is given that it will have these two types of errors.\n",
