    "# Continuous Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will introduce continuous random variables. Following a similar pattern to before, we will discuss a few of the basic ideas and then introduce some specific distributions that model common situations and have enough structure to them we can compute with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let's assume that our continuous random variable is taking values over the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ or some subset of the real numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Big Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "So the big difference between discrete random variables and continuous random variables is that for a Discrete Random Variable, the *Probability Distribution Function* gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(Y=y) = \\mbox{The probability that the discrete random variable Y takes on the value y}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the probabiliuty that the discrete random variables in an inteval:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(a \\leq Y \\leq b) = \\sum_{a \\leq y \\leq b} P(y) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cumulative Distribution Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The struggle is with a continuous random variable, is that the probability that the variable takes on a particular value must be 0.  This might seem strange, and it will become clearer as we get the structure set up, but the idea is that there is a continuum of values the variable can take and that menas having it land on any one value is impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define $F(y)$ to be the *Cumulative Distribution Function*:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F(y) = P(Y \\leq y) = \\mbox{The probability that Y is less than or equal to y} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$F(y)$ has some easy to derive properties for any continuous random variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $F(y)$ is a non-decreasing function (it accumulates the probabilities).\n",
    "- $F(y) \\to 0 $ as $y \\to - \\infty$\n",
    "- $F(y) \\to 1 $ as $y \\to \\infty$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $Y$ is a discrete random variable, then $F(y)$ has a jump discontinuity when $P(Y = y) \\neq 0$. \n",

    "### What is going on\n",
    "\n",
    "So as we predicted, the idea of summing over some values to get the probability has indeed turned into integration, with some caveats. The main one being that continuous functions $F(y)$ do not always have derivatives. (It turns out the non-decreasing part helps, but just think about functions with corners). The other probably being that PDF are not exactly the same Probability Distributions and in particular $f(y)$ is **NOT** $P(y)$.\n",
