    "\n",
    "To start, I would estimate two intervals of the THC concentration, one with 95% confidence and one with 99% confidence. Obviously, the interval with 99% confidence is going to be more accurate, but the interval will also be larger. On the flip side, the interval with 95% confidence is less accurate, but the interval will be smaller. I would be looking to see how large both intervals are (meaning do the intervals contain a greater range of numbers). If the results have been faked, I might expect the intervals to have a smaller range of values. Data that has not been fabricated will need to have a larger interval in order to reach the desired confidence level. Depending on how good the labs are at faking results, they might have not included enough outliers that would impact the size of the interval. It would be hard to pass too much judgement on the size of the intervals without another set of samples to compare it to, but it's still a starting place. The other piece I would be looking for is if the intervals include concentrations higher or lower than 20%. From looking at the graph of \"Largest Labs (Washington)\", it looks like a confidence interval of 99% and 95% would include concentrations well below 20%, probably somewhere around 5% or even lower. A lab that has manipulated the data will probably result in 20% being at the lower end of the interval, maybe 10% will be the lowest in the range. It might not be necessary to construct both 95% and 99% confidence intervals, but it's easy to do so why not have both. I wouldn't conclude anything on the confidence intervals alone, but it would be a good first step to trying to find if the data was manipulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next approach I would take is conducting hypothesis testing. I'd make the null hypothesis be the mean THC concentration is below 20% so the alternative hypothesis would be the mean contentration is at or above 20%. I'd go through all the steps I go through in question 4. If there's sufficient evidence to rejet the null hypothesis, then it would most likely be the case that the results from the labs were manipulated. I'd probably want at least 95% confidence, but ideally 99%. The results could lead to shutting down a lab which impacts people's livelihoods and I don't want to be taking too much of a chance that I am wrong. I might also take a further look into the rejection region and check for the chance of Type I and Type II errors. With so few samples, it's difficult to be too sure of anything.\n"
